Installation instructions
=========================

First make sure you have the django-cookiecontrol/cookiecontrol directory on your PYTHONPATH.

In your settings.py, make sure you have at least COOKIECONTROL_COUNTRIES and COOKIECONTROL_PRIVACY_URL set.
A full list of options is available in the README file.

Then add the application to your INSTALLED_APPS:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'cookiecontrol',
        ...
    )

Load the template library with 

    {% load cookiecontrol %}

And put the tag 

    {% cookiecontrol %}

somewhere in your base template's BODY, before you call any other scripts which might want to set cookies.
