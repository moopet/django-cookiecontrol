Requirements
============

Django 1.4 - well, why not? I use the new {% static %} template tag. Hack it out if you need < 1.4


Installation instructions
=========================

Go to http://civicuk.com/cookie-law/cookie_configuration_v5 to customise and download the latest version of Cookie Control.
Put the javascript file in /cookiecontrol/static/cookiecontrol/js/cookieControl.js
It's not included with this distribution due to having a conflicting license, and you probably want the latest version anyway, right?

Next make sure you have the django-cookiecontrol/cookiecontrol directory on your PYTHONPATH.

In your settings.py, make sure you have at least COOKIECONTROL_COUNTRIES and COOKIECONTROL_PRIVACY_URL set.
A full list of options is available in the README file.

Then add the application to your INSTALLED_APPS:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'cookiecontrol',
        ...
    )

Load the template library with 

    {% load cookiecontrol %}

And put the tag 

    {% cookiecontrol %}

somewhere in your base template's BODY, before you call any other scripts which might want to set cookies.
